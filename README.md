## Description on the quiz/project

The objective of this project is to create a quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz itself will be multiple choice and can be used as fun little exercise for those learning to code that want to test their knowledge. Number of questions included at present is limited but could be expanded upon in future.

The quiz itself will be timed and work on a point base system. Overall score will be determined by (time left x multiplier score(increases from successive correct answers)). The scores will then be saved into local storage and presented in a leaderboard.
